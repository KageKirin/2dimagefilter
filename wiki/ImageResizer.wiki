*Image resizer* is a free software designed for resizing image especially for upscaling low res pixel art image multiple times. This software contains many pixel art scaling algorithm that only can be found in video game emulators as image filter.

==Usage==

The user interface is very straightforward, you just:
  * Choose an image that you want to upscale;
  * Choose scaling method that you desire (I recommended use xBR 4x, but another method is also worth to be tried);
  * Set another parameter if necessary;
  * Save as your image.

==Limitations==
The limitation of pixel art algorithms are they only capable for upscaling picture in predefined size, such as 2x, 3x, or 4x and cannot be used to shrink images. The solution when you want to resize your picture with custom size is to upscale the picture with the pixel art scaling algorithms first, then shrink it with Lanczos or another general purpose algorithm until the desired size. 

Example: a pixel art image with dimension 2x2 pixel want to be scaled until 7x7 pixel (almost 4 times of its original size). So the solution is by using - let's say - Hq4x filter to magnify it until 8x8 pixel, then shrink it with lanczos filter to 7x7 pixel. The image will looks perfectly with this method.
